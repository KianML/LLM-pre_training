{"paper_id":"12187484","title":"Retinal metabolic abnormalities in diabetic mouse: comparison with diabetic rat.","abstract":"PURPOSE: Dogs and rats are commonly used to examine the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, but mouse is sparingly studied as an animal model of diabetic retinopathy. In this study metabolic abnormalities, postulated to contribute to the development of retinopathy in diabetes, are investigated in the retina of mice diabetic or galactose-fed for 2 months, and are compared to those obtained from hyperglycemic rats. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in mice (C57BL\/6) and rats (Sprague Dawley) by alloxan injection, and experimental galactosemia by feeding normal animals diets supplemented with 30% galactose. After 2 months of hyperglycemia, levels of lipid peroxides, glutathione, nitric oxides and sorbitol, and activities of protein kinase C and (Na-K)-ATPase were measured in the retina. RESULTS: Two months of diabetes or experimental galactosemia in mice increased retinal oxidative stress, PKC activity and nitric oxides by 40-50% and sorbitol levels by 3 folds, and these abnormalities were similar to those observed in the retina of rats hyperglycemic for 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic abnormalities, which are postulated to play important role in the development of diabetic retinopathy in other animal models, are present in the retina of diabetic mice, and the level of metabolic abnormalities is very comparable between mice and rats. Thus, mouse seems to be a promising animal model to study the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.","label":"Experimental Diabetes","predicted_ranked_labels":"Experimental Diabetes","explanation":"The article investigates metabolic abnormalities in the retina of mice with induced diabetes or galactosemia, and compares them to those in rats. The study aims to examine the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, and the results show similar metabolic abnormalities in both mice and rats. This suggests that the mouse model can be used to study diabetic retinopathy, making it an experimental diabetes study."}

Using this method, the metabolic changes in four spatially resolved longitudinal slices (where slice I is superficial and slice IV is deep muscle) through the ankle flexor muscles have been investigated at rest and during steady-state isometric twitch-contraction at 2 Hz. At rest, intracellular pH was lower, and phosphocreatine (PCr)\/ATP was higher, throughout the muscle mass in diabetic compared with control animals. The change in PCr\/ATP in diabetic muscle correlated with a decrease in the chemically determined ATP concentration. During the muscle stimulation period, the decrease in pH observed in diabetic muscle at rest was maintained, but not exacerbated, by the contractile stimulus. Stimulation of muscle contraction caused more marked changes in PCr\/(PCr + Pi), PCr\/ATP and Pi\/ATP in the diabetic group. These changes were most evident in slice III, which contains the greatest proportion of fast glycolytic-oxidative (type IIa) fibres, in which statistically significant differences were observed for all metabolite ratios. The results presented suggest that some degree of heterogeneity occurs in diabetic skeletal muscle in vivo with respect to the extent of metabolic dysfunction caused by the diabetic insult and that regions of the muscle containing high proportions of type IIa fibres appear to be most severely affected.","label":"Experimental Diabetes","predicted_ranked_labels":"Experimental Diabetes; Type 2 Diabetes","explanation":"The article discusses the effects of streptozotocin-diabetes on rat skeletal muscle metabolism, using 31P-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The study found changes in phosphocreatine (PCr)\/ATP, pH, and other metabolite ratios in the diabetic group, particularly in regions containing high proportions of fast glycolytic-oxidative (type IIa) fibres. This suggests that the diabetic insult causes metabolic dysfunction in the muscle, which is a characteristic of Type 2 Diabetes. The use of streptozotocin, a toxin that induces insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, also suggests that the study is related to Type 2 Diabetes."}
{"paper_id":"14654069","title":"Mitochondria respiration and susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic hearts.","abstract":"Cardiovascular complications are the primary cause of death for diabetic patients. Clinical and experimental observation has showed the development of dysfunctional cardiomyopathy as one of the main complications of diabetes. Whether the cardiomyopathy results from an increased susceptibility of cardiac tissue to ischemic insult or from a specific functional defect of cardiac mitochondria is a controversial issue. The investigation of possible functional defect in cardiac mitochondria from diabetic rats indicates a decline in state 3 respiration only in animals presenting a marked decrease in body weight. Mitochondria from rats presenting a level of hyperglycemia similar to diabetic animals but not the marked weight loss typical of the latter group show no decline in state 3 respiration, the values being indistinguishable from those of control mitochondria. Mitochondria from hyperglycemic rats, however, show a 15-20% increase in state 4 oxygen consumption but only when glutamate is used as energetic substrate, as compared to a 40-50% increase in state 4 respiration in mitochondria from diabetic rats under similar experimental conditions. This phenomenon is unrelated to diabetes duration, as it is observed at 2 as well as 8 weeks after diabetes onset. Taken together, these data argue against hyperglycemia per se being a direct cause of the decline in state 3 oxygen consumption observed in cardiac mitochondria of type-I diabetic rats and indicate that differences exist in cardiac mitochondrial function in rats generically labeled as diabetic. These differences can contribute to explain discrepancies in experimental results reported by various groups in the field and provide an additional parameter to be taken into consideration in evaluating the varying sensitivity of diabetic hearts to ischemia-reperfusion injury.","label":"Experimental Diabetes","predicted_ranked_labels":"Type 1 Diabetes","explanation":"The article specifically mentions 'type-I diabetic rats' and 'cardiac mitochondria of type-I diabetic rats', indicating that the study focuses on type 1 diabetes. Additionally, the article mentions that the decline in state 3 respiration is observed only in animals presenting a marked decrease in body weight, which is a characteristic of type 1 diabetes."}
{"paper_id":"16443886","title":"Mean blood glucose and biological variation have greater influence on HbA1c levels than glucose instability: an analysis of data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Mean blood glucose (MBG) over 2-3 months is a strong predictor of HbA(1c) (A1C) levels. Glucose instability, the variability of blood glucose levels comprising the MBG, and biological variation in A1C (BV) have also been suggested as predictors of A1C independent of MBG. To assess the relative importance of MBG, BV, and glucose instability on A1C, we analyzed patient data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A glucose profile set and sample for A1C were collected quarterly over the course of the DCCT from each participant (n = 1,441). The glucose profile set consisted of seven samples, one each drawn before and 90 min after breakfast, lunch, and dinner and one before bedtime. MBG and glucose instability (SD of blood glucose [SDBG]) were calculated as the arithmetic mean and SD of glucose profile set samples for each visit, respectively. A statistical model was developed to predict A1C from MBG, SDBG, and BV, adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, treatment group, stratum, and race. RESULTS: Data from 32,977 visits were available. The overall model was highly statistically significant (log likelihood = -41,818.75, likelihood ratio chi2[7] = 7,218.71, P > chi2 = 0.0000). MBG and BV had large influences on A1C based on their standardized coefficients. SDBG had only 1\/14 of the impact of MBG and 1\/10 of the impact of BV. CONCLUSIONS: MBG and BV have a large influence on A1C, whereas SDBG is relatively unimportant. Consideration of BV as well as MBG in the interpretation of A1C may enhance our ability to monitor diabetes management and predict complications.","label":"Type 1 Diabetes","predicted_ranked_labels":"Type 2 Diabetes","explanation":"The article discusses the analysis of data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, which focused on the relationship between mean blood glucose, biological variation, and glucose instability on HbA1c levels.

Compared with similar cultures from normal animals, these hepatocytes secreted less very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol, but the decrease in the secretion of VLDL non-esterified and esterified cholesterol was not so pronounced. This resulted in the secretion of relatively cholesterol-rich VLDL particles by the diabetic hepatocytes. Addition of insulin for a relatively short period (24 h) further decreased the low rates of VLDL triacylglycerol secretion from the diabetic hepatocytes. The secretion of VLDL esterified and non-esterified cholesterol also declined. These changes occurred irrespective of whether or not exogenous fatty acids were present in the culture medium. Little or no inhibitory effect of insulin was observed after longer-term (24-48 h) exposure to the hormone. Both dexamethasone and a mixture of lipogenic precursors (lactate plus pyruvate) stimulated VLDL triacylglycerol and cholesterol secretion, but not to the levels observed in hepatocytes from normal animals. The low rate of hepatic VLDL secretion in diabetes contrasts with the increase in whole-body VLDL production rate. This suggests that the intestine is a major source of plasma VLDL in insulin-deficient diabetes.","label":"Experimental Diabetes","predicted_ranked_labels":"Type 1 Diabetes","explanation":"The article specifically mentions that the hepatocytes were derived from streptozotocin-diabetic rats, which is a common model for inducing Type 1 Diabetes. The study also focuses on the effects of insulin on VLDL secretion, which is relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of Type 1 Diabetes."}
